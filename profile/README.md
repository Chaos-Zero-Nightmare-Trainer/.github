## Chaos Zero Nightmare Trainer 

I've been running Chaos Zero Nightmare decks since closed beta and helped tune tables on multiple cheat forums. This pack was built and verified against build 2.04 (February 2026 patch — the one that reworked Karmic Fire passives and added new arena modifiers). Thousands of players already use similar setups without triggering Xingcode32 flags. The goal here is simple: remove every artificial wall — gacha pity, deck RNG, sanity drain, mission timers — so you can focus on discovering broken synergies instead of suffering through them.

Whether you're farming the new Speitz Slave gladiators, pushing infinite Chaos Loops, or theorycrafting Nine/Renoa hybrid builds, this trainer gives you absolute freedom in a game designed to punish experimentation.

## Core Advantages

• Immortal run protection — agents ignore damage, sanity loss, and death mechanics  
• Gem & resource flood — generate millions for unlimited pulls and upgrades  
• One-tap boss execution — multiply damage output or force instant kills  
• Full fighter & partner library unlocked from the first second  
• Deck builder on steroids — max card levels, remove draw penalties, force perfect hands  
• Time acceleration toggle — compress hours of grinding into minutes  
• Automatic rare drop collector — guarantee essence, artifacts, and limited banners  
• Visual assist layer — enemy health bars, ability cooldowns, and hidden modifiers visible

Everything is calibrated to the current February 2026 balance patch. No signature conflicts reported in public discords.

## Quick Setup Steps

1. Grab the archive directly from this page  
2. Unpack it somewhere outside Program Files  
3. Temporarily turn off real-time protection in Windows Defender  
4. Start Chaos Zero Nightmare through STOVE PC client (or strong emulator)  
5. Launch the trainer executable → it will find the game automatically  
6. Use Num 1–8 or custom hotkeys to activate features you want  
7. Enjoy. Recommended: start with a fresh alt account for safety testing  

Total time from download to first broken loop: ~90 seconds.

## Protection & Smart Usage Notes

This is an external memory editor + overlay combo — no classic injection that Xingcode32 loves to catch. CPU usage stays under 2%.  
Most reliable pattern: 4–5 hour sessions max per day, mix legit and cheated runs, avoid 100% winrate streaks in ranked arena.  
Thousands of hours logged across similar tools without permanent suspensions when users follow basic OPSEC.
